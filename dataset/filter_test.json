Flames and smoke rise upwards from the burning aircraft, casting an ominous shadow over the surrounding area, while debris is scattered through the air. The air is filled with the acrid smell of gasoline from the plane's fuel tank and the burning grass and dirt below. A few people are standing at the roadside, their eyes wide with shock and fear; however, they rush away in panic from the scene.
